# 202020V Employee Salary


### Overview:

The company 202020V is looking for someone to create a database. The database must contain the employee info, salary and benefits recieved. I also was instructed to create a .csv of the salary and create 3 charts of the data comparison.


### What was learned:

In this project I was able to learn about DB Browser for SQLite. The software has an easy learning curve and was easy to install. After creating the database, I went VSCODE (don't ask me why I didn't use jupyter LOL) to do the coding. Accessed the database through pandas then went forth to print the employee salary table. After checking the data I started to create the new .csv file of the salary. I also did plots of three different ways to compare the data of the salaries. 

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SQLite3 (https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
- DB Browser for SQLite
