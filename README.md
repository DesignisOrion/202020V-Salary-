# 202020V Employee Salary


### Overview:

The company 202020V is looking for someone to create a database. The database must contain the employee info, salary and benefits recieved. 


### What was learned:

In this project I was able to learn about DB Browser for SQLite. The software has an easy learning curve and was easy to install. After creating the database, I went VSCODE (don't ask me why I didn't use jupyter LOL) to do the coding. Accessed the database through pandas then went forth to print the employee salary table.

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Pandas
- SQLite3 (https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
- DB Browser for SQLite
- Anaconda (VSCODE)
